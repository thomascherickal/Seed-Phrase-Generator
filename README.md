# Seed Phrase Generator & Checker

A Seed Phrase Generator is a tool designed to create a unique set of words that can be used to 
seed a cryptocurrency wallet, enabling users to securely store and access their digital assets. 
These seed phrases are typically made up of a sequence of 12 randomly generated words that act 
as a backup for the wallet. \
Using this generator you can search for old forgotten or lost wallets with preserved cryptocurrency.
